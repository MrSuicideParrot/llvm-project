# The LLVM-based Silhouette Compiler

This repository contains the source code of the LLVM-based Silhouette compiler.

## How to Compile
Compiling the Silhouette compiler is exactly the same as compiling a
standard LLVM compiler. Therefore you can compile it in whatever way you
are used to compiling the LLVM compiler infrastructure.
If you are not familiar with compiling LLVM, you can use this
[script](https://github.com/URSec/Silhouette-Misc/blob/master/scripts/build.llvm.sh)
to generate the Makefiles to compile the compiler.
